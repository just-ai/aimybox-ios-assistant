```

Add following in your `ViewController`

```swift

    var aimybox: Aimybox? = {
        let locale = Locale(identifier: "en")
        
        guard let speechToText = SFSpeechToText(locale: locale) else {
            fatalError("Locale is not supported.")
        }
        guard let textToSpeech = AVTextToSpeech(locale: locale) else {
            fatalError("Locale is not supported.")
        }
        
        let dialogAPI = AimyboxDialogAPI(api_key: "Awesome_API_Key",
                                         unit_key: UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor!.uuidString)
        
        let config = AimyboxBuilder.config(speechToText, textToSpeech, dialogAPI)
